Data Classification Guidance

Data Publishing Guidance [Section 2.3.2] (https://github.com/eCitizen/Connect/blob/master/DataPolicy-ExecutiveOrder/DataPolicy.md#section-232-apply-open-data-standards-guidance)

Determine the Publishing Priority of Open Data [Section 2.3.1] (https://github.com/eCitizen/Connect/blob/master/DataPolicy-ExecutiveOrder/DataPolicy.md#section-231-open-data-publishing-priority)

- Each department shall determine the publishing priority status of it’s Open Data.

- Once data is classified as open and not protected, the next step is to determine whether that data is appropriate for publishing on the City of Boston Open Data Portal. Some data that is public record technically may nonetheless be inappropriate for publishing as open data. For example, it is possible that some data, while individually public record can, if cross-tabulated by third parties with other openly available datasets, constitute an violation of reasonable expectations of privacy and other information security risks. Until applicable federal and state law catches up to these risks, it is important for each department to actively consider and use reasonable judgement as to whether data that has been classified as open is in fact appropriate to be published “as is” on the open data portal or not. In some cases, it may be advisable to redact certain features of the dataset to limit the potential risks of harm or to delay publishing of inappropriate data until a prudent and safe plan is adopted.

- After data has both been classified as open and also determined to be appropriate for publishing, then the department shall determine the priority order in which such data is to be published. Given the limited resources available to accomplish full publishing of all appropriate open data, it is important to prioritize the publishing of the most important data sets and to set a general priority-order for the publishing of all such data over a reasonable period of time.

- The priority status for establishing which Open Data to publish first shall be based upon due consideration of all factors relevant to that department and data.

- Priority publishing status may include consideration of whether the public interest is materially served by providing access to the data because:

- Volume: The data is of a type that is of significant size and continually provided and/or of very large size and periodically provided;
- Velocity: Rapid access to the data is important and rendering the data accessible through data.cityofboston.gov is the most effective, least expensive or otherwise highest value method to enable immediate access to the data;
- Variability: The data fluctuates at a high rate and access to the then current state of the data is of value
- Variety: The addition of the data, when used in
combination with other data sets, affords enhanced
compound value.
- Validity: The data sheds light upon the legitimacy of government or the acts of government, such as ethics disclosures and violations or the conduct of elections and response to election fraud or other violations;
- Veracity: The data provides verifiable metrics from an authoritative public source, such as weights and measures, census and vital statistics, reported crime, public health or other data sets for which accurate readings are required to correctly calibrate or response by sensitive, mission critical, high risk or high value systems; and
- Value: Rendering the data accessible via data.cityofboston.gov or an appropriate alternative publishing method in in the public interest and/or yields other material sources of value to government, the private sector, a definable subset of a sector and/or the public at large.

Action: Publication Priority Form

Publishing Workflow and Approval Chain

- Each department head shall confirm or update the names and contact information for the individuals noted on the Open Data Manager business and legal points of contact roster for their department.

- Each department head shall conduct an initial assessment of the types and amounts of data sets for which it is responsible. This assessment shall include:

The name of each data set whether the data set is expected to be classified as open and public or protected from disclosure;
A short one or two sentence abstract describing what the data is comprised of and how it is used by or with the department; and
The name of the software, platform or other system or systems through which the data flows or where the data is stored.
- Each department head shall establish a plan for the classification of its data sets as open or protected

- The departmental Open Data business contact shall deliver to the Open Data Manager their department initial assessment of its data sets and data classification plan

- Prior to publication, the department shall ensure that minimum relevant documentation describing the data accompanies the data set as published.

Expedite publishing of at least two open data sets

- This initial set of guidance on publishing open data is intended to provide sufficient detail to support the classification and publication of at least two datasets by every department on an expedited basis.

The experience gained by publishing some open data quickly will be an important source of information about the relevant data types and classification needs of each department. The process of publishing at least a couple of open data sets will also clarify or confirm the essential business, legal and technical elements relevant to the open data publishing workflow and approval chain for each department.

Action: Initial Assessment of Each Respective Department’s Data Types and Amounts

Outreach to stakeholder communities

- The business contact for Open Data of each department shall endeavor to identify the relevant stakeholder communities that will use and rely upon the publication of each open data set of their department, including identification of a simple, effective and repeatable means for notifying stakeholder communities of the availability of relevant published open data or the additions to or other updating of such open data.
